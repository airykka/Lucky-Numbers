# Lucky Numbers

Lucky Numbers is a one-player game developed solely with vanilla JS, HTML & pure CSS. In the game, there is a secret number and the player is expected to guess what that number is based on the feedback generated from their previous guesses.

2. Your goal is to guess what it is in 20 guesses or less.
3. The number falls between 1 and 99.
4. You lose the game when you run out of guesses.
5. The `Play Again` button allows you to try and beat your highscore.
